    <h1>ðŸœ— June 4th</h1>
    <p>I woke up with Gavin informing me that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft">GitHub had just been acquired by Microsoft</a>.</p>
    <p>I spent no monies.</p>
    <p>I watched the whole WWDC18 livestream and livetweeted about it which was sort of depressing.</p>
