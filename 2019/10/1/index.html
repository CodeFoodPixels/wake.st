    <h1>October 1st 2019</h1>
    Of course I am starting this at 1am like always. Writing directly into GitHub is a horrable way to write. I need to set up an infestructure for my own writing in a way that feels good. GitHub is obviously not where I want to have my website hosted but thats where I am at at the moment. 
    </br>
    I am really just writing cause I want to start writing again on a daily basis and where do you start but now. Also its the 1st so I get a new month to try this out. 
  </br>
    This feels sort of pointless. But maybe that is the point. Get over the feeling of pointlessness. I write two words and then get distracted reading shit. I need to learn how to focus. What is the point of writing if you are not trying to express anything. Well I guess I am trying to express the desire to have a writing practice and feel confident in my abilities to share thoughts in a longer form context.

I was just reading about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090402091619/http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2002/03/01/netochka/index.html">Netochka Nezvanova</a> and getting distracted by it. Its an interesting sidenote in the history of Max/MSP that the first big patch to add live video was made by a net.art-ist with a crazy reputation. There is some more recent convorsations about them on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=774594">hackernews</a>. Gossip is addictive. Of course I took note and got distracted again, but this time found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050720000620/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/research/fcramer/wordsmadeflesh/07-chapter_4/">Florien Cramer's article about Netochka</a> I guess my interest in this stuff goes back to my childhood. So many connections to different things. Rememering why any of this matters. Why I am sitting in strange loft in Berlin right now. How did I get here. How does Con Artist tie in with me being here? What strange humans have I bumped sholders with who I am now personally connected. I remember inviting Max and Weev to that noise show (wait was that also the show that PsychoEgyptianAryanBoy played at?) And then how did that lead me to be here now? My connection being that max invited me to work on this project and offered to buy tickets and such and then I somehow convinced Max to involve Paloma too. I wonder what we actually did? We were suppose to make artworks for all those special tlds Max had. The world is really small and inter connected. I think we could fit a lot more people in it. Maybe thats a good way to end this written document.
