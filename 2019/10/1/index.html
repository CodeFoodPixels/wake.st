    Of course I am starting this at 1am like always. Writing directly into GitHub is a horrable way to write. I need to set up an infestructure for my own writing in a way that feels good. GitHub is obviously not where I want to have my website hosted but thats where I am at at the moment. 
    
    I am really just writing cause I want to start writing again on a daily basis and where do you start but now. Also its the 1st so I get a new month to try this out.
